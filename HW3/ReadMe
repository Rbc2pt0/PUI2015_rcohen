I worked with Hannah Kates (in the Wednesday section) on part 2 of the assignment - we compared the answers we each obtained for the statistical tests and worked through the logic of the chi squared test together to confirm our answers. Hannah also helped me troubleshoot some of my code for assignment 1, though I wrote the final portions of the code independently.
