good comments that cover all key points 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===============================


the 2 points default in the legend should he substituted by a single plot as it is redundant and with large points it overlaps

missing units on x and y axis


the y tick labels should be in a more compressed readable notation, e.g. change units to millions


the empty space in the plot is distracting and does not help comparison (remember tufte's rules) 

the point size is unexplained

the color of Bk and Bx is indistinguishable at first sight

the legend shows "dot size reflects..." which belongs in a separate label, not in the legend, and it confuses the association of the blue color to SI.

size differential too large

NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED

===========

this is a tableau style visualization, not a plot (in fact a full poster)

as a poster it probably works well. 

if considered as a visualization it is too busy, fonts are too small. 

lets take the bottom panels as the plot: most panels cannot actually be judged because at the resolution at which i get the plots the legends are not readable.

the maps seem very busy: the gray structure underlying the dots/areas is probably unnecessary

even at full res i cannot imagine that the plots on the right would have axis labels and tick labels large enough. there is a lot of empty space on the left of the center right panel. probably it should be removed.

=====

good plot, good choice of BW and mean/median in read that highlights it. 

consider using a larger unit on the y axis (miles?)


jgrundy
=======
the plot is clear, colorblind compliant

consider a compressed notation for both axes: riders in units of 10,000 and res housing in units of 10,000 as well.

the line fits are too thin and at the edge of visibility
